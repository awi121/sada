            Pet owners want to keep their pets safe and happy when home alone, but monitoring them remotely can be challenging. We developed an AI-powered pet monitoring system that uses computer vision and audio detection to identify pet activities and sounds.

            The system uses YOLOX object detection to identify pets in the camera frame and feed this to a multi-modal Clip model for zero-shot activity recognition. The Clip model was trained on a dataset of pet activity images and descriptive captions. To detect pet noises, we added an audio classification model fine-tuned on a dataset of cat and dog sounds.

            To optimize compute, we implemented DeepSORT tracking to activate the vision models only when needed. The app displays highlights and timestamps on a timeline so owners can quickly review activities detected during long unattended periods.

            In testing, the system detected common pet activities like eating, sleeping, playing, etc with over 85% accuracy. The audio model identified barking, meowing, growling, and other noises with over 90% accuracy.

            By combining computer vision and audio sensing with efficient tracking, our system provides a comprehensive overview of a pet's activities and behaviors while home alone. The next step is real-world testing and feedback from pet owners to refine the models before productization.
        title: Attention-based Fusion Network for 3D Semantic Segmentation
        description: | 
            This project developed a novel deep learning approach for segmenting 3D point clouds captured by LiDAR sensors. Point cloud data is first projected into 2D range images containing spatial, depth, and intensity information. Self-attention layers extract features from each modality separately.

            A fusion module is then applied to merge the modality-specific features using pairwise cross-attention. This allows the model to learn complex inter-modal relationships. The fused features are passed to a convolutional segmentation network to generate per-pixel semantic predictions.

            In experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset, our approach achieved a mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of 45.5% while operating at 24 FPS. This is comparable to prior state-of-the-art projection-based methods like RangeNet++ and PolarNet but with higher computational efficiency.

            The core novelty of our work is the attention-based feature fusion module. By processing each modality independently and fusing with cross-attention, our model can better handle the challenges of multi-modal 3D data. Our modular design also allows flexibility to incorporate additional sensing modalities in the future.

            In conclusion, we demonstrate the viability of using attention mechanisms for fusing multi-modal features in 3D segmentation models. Our work provides a strong foundation for further research into attention-based architectures for processing LiDAR and other 3D data.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
